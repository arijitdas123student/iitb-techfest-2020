# IIT BOMBAY TECHFEST 2020 Project Submission For Computational Agriculture Challenge

**Project Name :** AgriImpulse 

**Tagline :** Food is the key element required for life. What if we tell you that you can make the food invulnerable!

**Case Study :** In modern Agriculture and Forestry purposes Plant Pathological Research is very much essential for the crop improvement. In every year, huge crop is damaged by pathogen attack. In most of the cases, Farmers and lay men suffers huge loss due to severe pathogenic infestation. For crop improvement, the first and foremost essential key point is diseases identification. After proper identification of diseases we will be able to treat the diseases. Most of the cases lab oriented research is time taking and very much expendable but instant identification of plant diseases with its causal organism by using modern technology is most suitable and cost effective and also authentic. This type identifying methodology will help us to identify the diseases with its proper control measures. Above 95 % accuracy and authentic identification is possible by using this methodology.

As per Wikipedia The impact of pesticides consists of the effects of pesticides on non-target species. Pesticides are chemical preparations used to kill fungal or animal pests. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields.Runoff can carry pesticides into aquatic environments while wind can carry them to other fields, grazing areas, human settlements and undeveloped areas, potentially affecting other species. Other problems emerge from poor production, transport and storage practices.Over time, repeated application increases pest resistance, while its effects on other species can facilitate the pest's resurgence.

Each pesticide or pesticide class comes with a specific set of environmental concerns. Such undesirable effects have led many pesticides to be banned, while regulations have limited and/or reduced the use of others. The global spread of pesticide use, including the use of older/obsolete pesticides that have been banned in some jurisdictions, has increased overall.

Thus we can conclude that even though pesticides and insecticides are pretty useful but now a days the reverse of it i.e. harmfulness is getting increased in a rapid rate.

**Idea :** So the point arises - " What can we do to control usage of pesticides ? ".

Over here we should keep one thing in mind is that we need to make a system which can lower down or even maybe track down the usage of pesticides cause we can't pull it down for some obvious reasons to maintain the agriculture industry.

**Theory :** In our project we will be using the feature and characteristics of being warm-blooded mammal called thermoregulation. Here is a image showing the presence of thermoregulation and being scanned by a IR scanner camera -

So basically we will scan up using the AMG8833 Sensor Camera breakout using the OpenMV Cam H7+  and it will show up whether the pest is present there or isn't. And it will then tell us where to exactly spray the insecticide or pesticide and where shouldn't.
